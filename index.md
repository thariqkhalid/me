As the purpose of this repo is implementing neural networks, we chose to implement three different models VGG, Inception, Resnet from scratch since these three models have different structures and good examples for CNN. The three networks are implemented according to the descriptions that are mentioned in their papers Sources(https://github.com/thariqkhalid/perception4all#sources)
